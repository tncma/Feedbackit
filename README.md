### FeedbackIt
*Feedbacks on the Go. *

#### Introduction

Government Services and Products are like any other products and services that we have in the market today. They require constant upgrading and maintainance based on various parameters. Feedbacks from the ones who use these services and products come in the top category in the list of parameters.

With the amount of people who use these Government services, we can get so many useful insights,feedbacks and suggestions on how to make the existing status quo better and more efficient. Imagine the power of a community which has useful feedbacks and suggestions for all the services provided by our Government! With that in mind, we have built FeedbackIt, a platform which enables users to submit feedbacks, ideas and suggestions on any service that they use on Real Time basis.

#### Description
	
	1) Enable users to provide feedbacks/ideas/suggestions on various categories like education, transport, sanitation and health.

	2) Share the feedback and get up-voted. Popular feedbacks get featured in the main page.

	3) View feedbacks based on category. 

	4) Admin can view feedacks based on categories and reply to users in the form of Email regarding the feedback.

	5) Adding relevant image, date and location to a feedback.

##### TODO
	
	1) Adding multi language support.

	2) Adding more admins based on location. For example, the category Transport can have multiple admins based on location. There can be a transport admin in Madurai and Chennai. This process would help us distribute the incoming feedbacks based on locations and categories.

	3) Making a mobile app which will let users upload feedbacks on the go.

#### Initial Setup 
	
	1) The entire app built on Ruby on Rails. Install necessary gems.
